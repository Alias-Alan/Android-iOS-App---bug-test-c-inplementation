It's hard to listen
when you're speaking
It's hard to feel full
when you're leaking
It's hard to find compassion 
for those bottoming out
when you're peaking
I'm thinking

It's easy to climb up the mountain
It's hard to brave the fall
It's easy to get high and ignore life
It's hard to make the call
It's hard to take it easy
but it's easy to be hard

It's hard to see a man die
It's easy to look away
It's hard to realize life is a game
but once you do, it's fun to play.
